# __CISA CVE Vulnrichment ETL Data pipeline__

## __Overview__
This project implements a production-grade ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Apache Airflow to process Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) data enriched by CISA's Authorized Data Publisher (ADP) Vulnrichment program (https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/). 

The pipeline handles 120,000+ raw JSON vulnerability records, transforms them into structured formats, and stores them in a data lake for storage and data warehouse architecture.

## __Project Architecture__

### _Technology Stack_
1. __Data Engineering Tools__
-_Apache Airflow (v2.9.3)_: Workflow orchestration and scheduling
-_PostgreSQL_: Metadata database for Airflow state management
-_Docker (Compose)_: Containerization and service management
-_Python (v3.11)_:  Core programming language for data processing

2. __Google Cloud Platform (GCP)__
-_Google Cloud Storage_: Data lake for raw CVE JSON files
-_BigQuery_: Data warehouse for structured vulnerability records
-_Compute Engine_: VM hosting the Airflow orchestration platform

### _System Components_
The pipeline operates on a GCP Compute Engine VM (e2-medium) with 2 vCPUs, 4GB RAM running Ubuntu 22.04, and consists of three primary layers:
- _Orchestration Layer_: Apache Airflow 2.9.3 with scheduler and webserver for workflow management
- _Data Storage_: PostgreSQL database for Airflow metadata
- _Runtime_: Python 3.11 with Docker Compose for containerization

### _Data Flow_
1. __Stage 1: Extract raw cve JSONS into GCS data lake__
- Extracts raw jsons for cve records from CISA Vulnrichment github repository via REST API
- Parallelly extract raw JSONs using ThreadPoolExecutor threads in a two-stage process
- Insert raw JSONs into Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets  

2. __Stage 2: Transform raw data and load to BigQuery data warehouse__
- Retrives raw JSONs from data lake and transforms into into flattened, structured records
- Employs Transfer Manager with 10-15 workers to create preliminary staging table
- Merges staging table with final table and loads into BigQuery data warehouse
- Enables SQL-based analytics and reporting on vulnerability metrics
